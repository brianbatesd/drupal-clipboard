<h2>Policy of Nondiscrimination Statement</h2>

<p>The City of Vancouver (City) assures that no person shall on the grounds of race, color, national origin, or sex as provided by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (P.L. 100.259) be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any City sponsored transportation program or activity.

<p>Title VI compliance is a condition of receipt for federal funds, including funds from the Federal Highway Administration. Assurance of compliance falls under the proper authority of the City pursuant to its budgetary authority and responsibility. The Public Works Director and Transportation Title VI Coordinator are authorized to ensure compliance with provisions of this policy and with the law, including the requirements of 23 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 200 and 49 CFR 21.</p>
