<h2>Just because the label says &#39;flushable&#39; doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s treatable or good for plumbing.</h2>

<p><strong>July 1, 2022:</strong> A new <strong>Do Not Flush</strong> labeling law went into effect across Washington state. The Do Not Flush symbol must be clearly visible on packaging of disposable wipes products sold in Washington, including baby wipes and cleaning wipes. Disposable wipes that are flushed instead of thrown in the trash can create clogs and overflows to local waterways. Remember, flush only toilet tissue!</p>

<p>Many products, such as wipes, claim to be flushable. However, that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re treatable in our wastewater system. The fact is, some things should NEVER be flushed down the toilet or washed down the drain.</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s what you should know to protect your home&#39;s plumbing, your community&#39;s collection and treatment system and your environment:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Cleaning rags, reinforced paper towels, baby diapers and wipes, feminine hygiene products, surgical or medical bandages and tubing, pads and prescription drugs don&#39;t belong in the toilet or in the municipal wastewater treatment system. Flushing these can clog your plumbing and cause big damage at your home or miles down the line.</li>
<li>Wastewater treatment facilities are sophisticated systems designed primarily to treat organic wastes, such as human waste and household wastewater, with sensitive, natural processes doing the work of breaking them down safely. Untreatable products can interfere with or skirt those natural processes and harm pipes, pumps, systems and the environment. And what does make it through must be captured, pulled out of the system and trucked to a landfill. That&#39;s a very expensive, labor-intensive way to dispose of something.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please flush wisely to protect pipes and the environment.</strong></p>

<p>Safely dispose of wipes, rages, reinforced towels, baby diapers, feminine hygiene products, surgical supplies and pads in the garbage.
