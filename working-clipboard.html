    <p>The City&#39;s Transportation Plan update is an in-depth planning process that will explore transportation needs and priorities in partnership with Vancouver residents, employees and visitors. The project will examine existing travel conditions for all users of the city&#39;s transportation system, including those who drive, walk, bicycle, ride transit or deliver freight. The City will also talk to residents about their transportation priorities, with additional focus on communities that have been historically under-served by transportation investments.</p>
    
    <p>Building from these conversations over the coming year, Vancouver Moves will identify recommended policies, programs and projects to guide the City&#39;s transportation future.</p>
    
    <h2>Why transportation matters</h2>
    
    <p>Vancouver residents depend on the transportation system every day. Transportation matters because everyone in Vancouver deserves a safe and reliable transportation system that meets their daily needs.</p>
    
    <p>Since 2010, Vancouver has welcomed more than 14,000 new residents and 10,000 new jobs, meaning the transportation system must meet the needs of a growing community. The transportation system must also adapt to changing community needs due to COVID-19 while supporting the city&#39;s health and economy.</p>

    <h2>How Vancouver Moves tomorrow</h2>
    
    <p>The way people move is changing, which is being accelerated by the impacts of COVID-19 and our climate crisis. Innovations in transportation services are increasing travel options and customer convenience. These changes offer opportunities to improve mobility and accessibility for all, especially for some of our most vulnerable populations. They also pose challenges to the effective operation of our transportation infrastructure and our ability to uphold community values. Our new transportation vision needs to consider the changes in transportation technology and leverage the right mix of innovations to deliver a safer, more vibrant, and more prosperous city.</p>
