<p>Vancouver (USA) Fire Boat 1 performed an only-seconds-to-spare rescue on the Columbia River on June 22 (incident video below). With a victim slipping off a log boom in 55 degree water with 6-8 knot current, FB1 Pilot John Stewart used the vessel&rsquo;s twin jets for a masterful downriver approach and then held position while being buffeted by cross-currents wrapping around the Interstate Bridge piers. Deckhand Scotty Edwards did a tremendous job communicating with the victim from the bow ramp and getting him aboard, and Captain Jerry Underwood (a former boat pilot) provided calm leadership and made quick decisions. Vancouver Fire&rsquo;s boat crews are experienced, well trained, and know how to use Fire Boat 1 to its fullest potential. Proud of our team, and as our US Coast Guard partners would say, Bravo Zulu!<br />

June 27 update: Great to see the interest this video has generated. In answer to a few questions and comments:<br />
-Fire Boat 1 is designed to hold position in strong currents and use the articulating bow ramp to help extract victims from the water - our crews are highly skilled and train often to do this. We certainly practice throwing lines and using rescue poles, but on the Columbia River we prefer to get close to cold water immersion victims and make positive, hands on contact from the boat whenever possible.<br />
-Though it might be hard to see, all members of the crew are wearing PFDs and the deckhand on the bow is safety tethered to the boat.<br />
-People wind up in the river near the bridges for a multitude of reasons. Whatever their intent, we are there to help.</p>
