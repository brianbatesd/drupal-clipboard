<p>I hope this message finds you all healthy and safe as we move into the holiday season. The last 20 months have truly been a time of change and adaptation, testing our resiliency more than we could have ever imagined before the pandemic hit. Our lives, our work, our pastimes and even our relationships had to be put on hold to varying degrees at one time or another during this time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to share that one of our major city initiatives, <strong><a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/cmo/page/stronger-vancouver">A Stronger Vancouver</a></strong>, which was also put on hold by the pandemic in March 2020, is now finding a path forward as part of the City&rsquo;s next strategic plan.<a id="Stronger" name="Stronger"></a></p>

<p>Earlier this year, City Council decided to pursue revisiting the A Stronger Vancouver effort, which is based on work that we did between 2017 to 2020 to create a long-term, multi-action plan to keep our city thriving over the next decade. In October, City Council affirmed this new unified approach of integration of the A Stronger Vancouver initiative into the strategic plan, which simplifies and consolidates our efforts and helps address our desire to present a predictable sequence of events that the community can understand, appreciate and plan for.</p>

<p>Development of the City&rsquo;s new strategic plan is getting under way now and will be built on a set of core values and focus areas already affirmed by City Council, the work completed with A Stronger Vancouver, plus fresh analysis and community engagement. The core values and focus areas already affirmed by the City Council are:</p>

<p>While the specific outcomes for each focus area haven&rsquo;t been defined yet, I can tell you that the City&rsquo;s new strategic plan will incorporate the hard work, community feedback and positive results generated by the Stronger Vancouver initiative in 2017-19. There will also be additional opportunities to provide input on the new plan in the coming months. We expect the final strategic plan to go before City Council for approval in mid-2022.</p>

<p>Our community has and will continue to change in the coming years. Nearly 20,000 more people call Vancouver home since 2017, and the experiences during the pandemic have highlighted new and different community hopes, needs and priorities. These changes are real, but two key things remain the same: while the City of Vancouver is committed to realizing our community&rsquo;s vision and aspirations, <strong>the basic revenue system that pays for local government services does not keep up with growth and inflation</strong>.</p>

<p>To achieve our community&rsquo;s aspirations, we will continue to work with our businesses and residents to develop of a vision-driven, long-term, comprehensive and sustainable solution to fund a full range of City services. The work we did with A Stronger Vancouver dovetails naturally with the key service areas that will be addressed in our new strategic plan, including improved public safety and community livability, becoming a more equitable and sustainable community, and increasing economic opportunity for our residents.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the many stakeholders, city and community leaders, and community members who participated in the development of the A Stronger Vancouver initiative. That effort will help assure Vancouver remains a safe, livable and vibrant city; one that attracts businesses and creates equitable opportunity for shared community prosperity. The groundwork laid by the Stronger Vancouver effort will now be part of a firm foundation for our strategic plan, which will guide the City&rsquo;s work for years to come.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an incredibly exciting time for Vancouver, and optimistic about how our work together can guide us to an even brighter future!</p>
