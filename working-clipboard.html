<p>The 2018 Washington State Energy Code (WSEC) is in effect as of February 1, 2021.</p>

<h2>Commercial</h2>

<p>Note that Commercial Provisions apply to all commercial occupancies, Group R-2 and R-3 occupancies greater than 3 stories above grade, and Group R-1 (all building heights). Further, compliance with the Energy Code is required throughout WA State for all new construction, additions, and retrofits.</p>

<p>The WSEC is significantly more stringent than the IECC and requires additional efficiency design elements for compliance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://waenergycodes.com/">online compliance documentation</a> <strong>webtool printout should be submitted</strong> with your building, electrical, or mechanical permit to show compliance with the code provisions that apply to the project and the design measures taken to comply with these provisions. Please note that the COMcheck is <em>not</em> permitted due to the Washington Amendments.</p>

<h2>Residential</h2>

<p>New to the Energy Code? There are many resources available through the <a href="http://www.energy.wsu.edu/BuildingEfficiency/EnergyCode/AdditionalResources.aspx#New">WSU Energy Program.</a></p>

<p>Residential codes encourage a more efficient use of energy through leak and blower door testing, duct sealing, higher insulation values, indoor and outdoor lighting fixture efficacy requirements, and compliance of all space-conditioning systems, which includes air handlers, outdoor condensing units of a split system air conditioner or heat pump, cooling or heating coil or furnace exchanger.</p>

<p>Forms may also be downloaded from the <a href="http://www.energy.wsu.edu/BuildingEfficiency/EnergyCode.aspx">WSU Energy Program.</a></p>

<p>New construction and additions require the following forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prescriptive Worksheet</li>
<li>Glazing Schedule</li>
<li>Heating System Sizing Worksheet</li>
