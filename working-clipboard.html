<h2 style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Project Overview</h2>

<p>The City of Vancouver Brownfields Assessment Project is funded through a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Brownfields Coalition Assessment Grant, which supports environmental investigation of properties that are suspected of being contaminated by hazardous materials or petroleum. The City of Vancouver, in partnership with Clark County Public Health and the Vancouver Housing Authority, are working together to further local subarea revitalization, economic development, environmental protection, and housing goals.</p>

<p>This project will primarily focus on assessments in the Fourth Plain focus area in central Vancouver but could also include other potential sites in other areas of the city and throughout Clark County. The Fourth Plain focus area includes an area around a five mile stretch of Fourth Plain Boulevard between I-5 and I-205.</p>

<p>This grant allows the City to work with property owners who think that the historic use of their property may have led to contamination and provide them with the resources to conduct environmental assessments of their property. This is a three-year grant expected to end September 30, 2023. The City is recruiting interested property owners to partner with.

				<p>The project team will work with interested property owners at key sites to determine their specific environmental constraints and facilitate clean-up activities if needed, as well as engage the community and area stakeholders in site reuse and design for future redevelopment. Participation is entirely voluntary. The project is funded by a $600,000 Brownfields Coalition Grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to complete the following work over three years:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Update and expand the City&#39;s brownfields site inventory to include the expanded Clark County geography (the original site inventory was completed with a 2013 EPA Brownfields Community-Wide Assessment Grant and only addresses City of Vancouver Brownfields sites).</li>
					<li>Conduct up to 15 Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs), evenly divided between petroleum and hazardous substance sites (10 ESAs to be included in the Fourth Plain target area).</li>
					<li>Conduct up to 12 Phase II ESAs, evenly divided between petroleum and hazardous substance sites (8 ESAs to be included in the target area)</li>
					<li>Prepare Analysis of Brownfield Cleanup Alternatives (ABCAs) at one hazardous substance site and one petroleum site.</li>
					<li>Develop an Area-Wide Plan (AWP) and a Final Cleanup Plan for up to two brownfield impacted areas, potentially including real estate market analysis, infrastructure assessment, conceptual reuse planning and design, and targeted community outreach and engagement.</li>

				<p>According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a brownfield is defined as a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of hazardous substances, pollutants, contaminants, controlled substances, petroleum or petroleum products, or is mine-scarred land.</p>

		</div>
		<div aria-labelledby="headingFourA" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseFourA">
			<div class="panel-body">

				<p>The impacts of brownfields can extend beyond the boundaries of the property to affect the surrounding community and environment. Left in their current state, these properties can:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Harm human health and the environment</li>
					<li>Become eyesores and contribute to blight</li>
					<li>Limit economic growth and development</li>
					<li>Reduce employment opportunities and tax revenue</li>
					<li>Reduce surrounding property values</li>
					<li>Contribute to neighborhood crime</li>
				</ul>

				<p>People often think of contaminated properties as large factories in big cities, but most sites are small properties such as former gas stations, repair shops, and dry cleaners. In smaller communities the impact of these sites can be disproportionately large.</p>

		</div>
		<div aria-labelledby="headingFiveA" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseFiveA">
			<div class="panel-body">

				<p>There are two main categories of contamination: hazardous substances and petroleum:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Hazardous substances</strong> tend to include heavy metals (such as lead), chemicals used by the historic owner (such as those used for dry cleaning, wood treating, mechanical repair, etc.), and asbestos in old structures.</li>
					<li><strong>Petroleum</strong> is often found around old automotive shops and gas stations that have or had underground storage tanks, fueling operations, and used petroleum products for operations.</li>

		</div>
		<div aria-labelledby="headingSixA" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseSixA">
			<div class="panel-body">

				<p>There are essentially three ways to clean up a property:</p>

				<ol>
					<li><strong>Dig &amp; Haul:</strong> Dig out contaminated soil and haul it away</li>
					<li><strong>Treat in Place:</strong> Use technologies, such as injection of chemicals to break down the contamination, that can treat the soil or groundwater in the ground</li>
					<li><strong>Engineering Controls:</strong> Measures that bound contamination so that it is contained in place. An example of engineered controls include placing a layer of clean material over contaminated soils to limit contact with contamination.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>These options vary in price and the extent to which the contamination is fully removed. It is rare that every inch of contaminated soil must be removed from a property. What cleanup really does is <strong>break the pathways of exposure.</strong> This means figuring out how humans and the environment could be exposed to contamination (i.e. through breathing in vapors, coming into contact with soil, or drinking the water) and putting in barriers to keep that from happening, such as vapor barriers, soil caps, and water treatment.</p>

				<p>The extent to which contaminated soil or groundwater needs to be removed depends on how the affected property will be used. If the site is going to be used for new offices, the office building and parking lot can act as a cap that prevents contact with the subsurface contamination. Whereas, if the site is going to become a park where people frequently come into contact with the soil or groundwater, some amount of dig and haul may be required to eliminate exposure.</p>

				<p>The legal framework around a contaminated property is built so that the current property owner is responsible even if he/she did not cause the pollution - unless they have been granted liability protection from the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology).

		<div aria-labelledby="headingEightA" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseEightA">
			<div class="panel-body">

				<p>The grant funds can provide funding for environmental investigations to help you find out if your property is contaminated or get documentation asserting that there is no reason to suspect contamination. If some contamination is found, the grant has funding available for up to two properties to create a plan to clean up the property and a market study to provide information about what types of development might suit the property. Remember that the extent (and thus cost) of cleanup depends on the future property use.</p>

				<p>While it is certainly a bit scary to suspect that your property might have some contamination, selling without an environmental investigation is hard to do. To get a loan to buy a property, most banks require a Phase I environmental site assessment (like the ones funded by the grant) before issuing the loan. By going through this process, the City can use these funds to help make the property <em>more</em> marketable if you wish to sell it.</p>

				<p>A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) uses existing information to understand the property conditions by examining current and historical uses of the site and potential threats to human health or the environment. The Phase I ESA includes reviewing historical land uses; conducting environmental records review, site visits, interviews with property owners and operators; and preparing a comprehensive report that contains all of that information.</p>

				<ol>
					<li><strong>What is the purpose of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment?</strong>
						<br>The purpose of conducting a Phase I environmental site assessment (ESA) is to obtain innocent landowner protections through an environmental due diligence process. A Phase I ESA gives property owners a liability defense and satisfies all appropriate inquiries. It is often required by lenders prior to developing land and can support decision making when deciding how the land should be developed.</li>
					<li><strong>What are the outcomes of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment?</strong>
						<br>Once a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) is completed the environmental conditions are documented and formalized. A recognized environmental condition is the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products in, on, or at a property that could pose a threat to the environment and/or human health. The Phase I ESA also must be completed prior to a Phase II ESA.</li>

<h3>2013 EPA Brownfields Grant Projects</h3>

<p>In 2013, the City of Vancouver was awarded an EPA Brownfields Community Wide Planning Grant, which was used to establish a citywide brownfields site inventory and conduct environmental assessments on key individual sites. 14 Phase I and/or II Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) and two remediation plans were completed, and the City was able to prepare several brownfields sites for future redevelopment. Key accomplishments include:</p>

				<p>Block 10, informally known as Heritage Square, was an undeveloped city block located in the heart of downtown Vancouver between Columbia and Washington streets and 8th and 9th streets. It was one of the last remaining undeveloped blocks in the downtown area.</p>

				<p>The City of Vancouver purchased the block in 1993 for future redevelopment, and utilized the 2013 EPA Brownfields grant to perform a Phase I and Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) on the property to support future redevelopment.</p>

				<p>In May 2020, the City of Vancouver sold Block 10 to Holland Partner Group for redevelopment. The project includes:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Two distinct four-story towers above a two-story shared parking garage and first floor retail space</li>
					<li>One tower will offer 79,000 square feet of office space</li>
					<li>The other tower will have 110 apartment units - 20% of the units will be more affordable, &ldquo;workforce&rdquo; housing</li>
