<h2>Neighborhood Associations</h2>

<p>Although they are often confused, neighborhood associations are <strong>NOT</strong> the same as homeowner associations.</p>

<p>Neighborhood associations are independent organizations that bring neighbors together to work with the City of Vancouver to address neighborhood problems, share&nbsp;information, provide opportunities for community input, and undertake projects to benefit the neighborhood. The city has built strong partnerships between city hall and the community through relationships with recognized neighborhood associations.</p>

<p>Vancouver has 69 officially recognized neighborhood associations that span over 95 percent of the city&#39;s population and geography. Membership in a neighborhood association includes everyone who owns property, rents a home, lives and/or works in the neighborhood boundaries. <em>If you live or work in the City of Vancouver, it is very likely that you belong to a neighborhood association!</em></p>

<h2>Neighborhood Association Meetings</h2>

<p>Most neighborhood associations have regular meetings of the membership. Meeting agendas are set by the Neighborhood Association officers. Check the individual neighborhood association pages for newsletters with more information.</p>

<h2>Office of Neighborhoods</h2>

<p>The <a href="/cmo/page/office-neighborhoods">Office of Neighborhoods</a> provides City residents, City Council and staff with responsive, coordinated services that promote and support collaboration and communication among residents and City government through recognized neighborhood associations.</p>
