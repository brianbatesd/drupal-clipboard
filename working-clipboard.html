<p>The Vancouver Police Department has become aware of increased rates of utility trailer thefts and prowls in our area as well as construction site thefts.</p>

<h2>Construction Site Theft</h2>

<p>Each year nearly $1 billion of construction equipment, tools and vehicles are stolen from construction sites. Many of the items are never recovered by police. Implementing crime prevention strategies can help protect property, and in the event of a theft, can assist with identification and recovery of property.<br />
<br />
Keeping these crime prevention tips in mind can help prevent job site theft:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Put Equipment Away</strong><br />
One of the easiest ways to protect your construction site is putting all your equipment away after using it and locking it inside a building or mobile storage unit before leaving the job site.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Records of Purchases</strong><br />
Keep detailed records of every piece of equipment you&rsquo;re using on the job site. These records also make it easier to file a police report and more challenging for the thief to sell the items later.</li>
<li><strong>Turn Off Equipment Circuit Breakers</strong><br />
A thief can&rsquo;t steal a large piece of equipment if they can&rsquo;t start it.</li>
<li><strong>Cut Fuel Supplies</strong><br />
Install a fuel pump kill switch in vehicles or equipment that require fuel.</li>
<li><strong>Install Secure Fencing</strong><br />
While fencing wont keep absolutely everyone away from the property, it does act as a deterrent and makes it more challenging for a thief to walk away with construction supplies.</li>
<li><strong>Lock All Vehicles</strong><br />
One of the most straightforward steps you can take around the construction site is locking all vehicles, especially when they are left unattended (day or night).</li>
<li><strong>Hire a Security Guard</strong><br />
If your project has the budget, a security company to monitor or patrol your site, especially after hours can deter or eliminate theft.</li>
<li><strong>Install a Security System</strong><br />
If your project has the budget, installing a security system that alerts a security company whenever someone enters the site can be a great deterrent.</li>
<li><strong>Increase lighting and visibility</strong><br />
Install ample lighting and make sure equipment and tools are not blocked by other items such as lumber, construction trailers or vehicles.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Utility Trailer Theft</h2>

<p>Utility trailers are typically stolen or prowled when they are left unattended at job sites or on business premises. In an effort to prevent trailer thefts and prowls and theft of business equipment we are sharing some crime prevention tips related to theft of utility trailers and construction equipment.</p>

<h2>Tips to prevent utility trailer theft:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Keep an updated itemized log of trailer contents (including serial numbers, values, and photos). Mark all property and equipment with the name and phone number of the business.</li>
<li>Enhance security, visibility, and lighting in places where trailers or other equipment are parked.</li>
<li>Consider having a fabricator weld the business name and phone number on the frame of the trailer near the hitch. This will require a great deal of effort for the thief to remove. If the trailer is stolen and found, this will expedite the process to return the trailer.</li>
<li>Use florescent spray paint to paint the business name and phone number in large font on the interior of the trailer. If a thief attempts to sell the trailer, florescent paint will act as a deterrent since it is hard to cover up with other paints.</li>
<li>Mark the exterior of the trailer with business decals, unique paint or other unique lettering that makes identification easy. Be sure to take photos of the trailer that can be provided to the police if the property is stolen.</li>
<li>Use anti-theft trailer equipment (i.e., wheel locks, coupler locks, active GPS tracking devices, etc.). These items are readily available online and in auto parts stores.</li>
<li>Make access to the trailer&rsquo;s hitch difficult (i.e., parking another vehicle in front of the trailer, blocking it in).</li>
<li>If the trailer is left parked in a single location for a length of time, consider removing one or all of the wheels.</li>
<li>Use a quality lock to secure the trailer to a fixed object (i.e., a tree, light pole, etc.).</li>
<li>Mark all equipment with the business name, owner initials, or phone number. This makes reselling equipment more difficult.</li>
<li>Use anti-theft door locks on enclosed trailers. Making the contents inside of a trailer more difficult to access can deter thieves from prowling the trailer.</li>
<li>Park the trailer in a secure, fenced area. Posting visible surveillance cameras and signage can often deter thieves.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to do if your property is stolen or prowled</h2>

<ul>
<li>Report trailer thefts and theft of any tools or equipment promptly to the police. Successful recovery of stolen equipment, to include trailers and their contents, relies upon accurate and timely reporting.</li>
<li>When purchasing used contracting equipment from a third party, do your due diligence (check for markings, purchase from reputable sources, etc.) to ensure you are not purchasing stolen equipment.</li>
