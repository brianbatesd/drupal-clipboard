<h2 id="leaks">Don&#39;t Drip &amp; Drive</h2>

<p>Got a leaky car but not sure what to do until you can get it into the shop? Prevent pollution by keeping drips and leaks cleaned up when you&rsquo;re parked at home.</p>

<p>Oil doesn&rsquo;t dissolve in rain water and a little bit goes a long way to polluting our streams and groundwater. Here&#39;s how to keep it clean:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a dry absorbent, such as some types of kitty litter, to soak up oily spots or green antifreeze puddles.</li>
<li>Try a spill pan or drip sheet to collect your leaks. Or park over a dry piece of cardboard until you can get to a shop and get it repaired.</li>
<li>Need help with your leak? Visit <a href="https://www.stormwaterpartners.com/dont-drip-and-drive-main">www.stormwaterpartners.com</a> for more information and get a coupon for $50 off repairs.</li>
</ul>

<p>To report spills, dripping oil or oily sheen on public streets, call the Public Works Operations Services at 360-487-8177. For urgent concerns after hours, please follow the prompts.</p>

<h2 id="pressure">Pressure Washing</h2>

<p>Spring weather got you thinking about cleaning up around the house? If you&rsquo;re planning to have your carpets cleaned, your home painted, or your driveway washed, before you sign an agreement, make sure your contractor will be properly disposing of the waste. Here are some questions you can ask of contractors in advance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do they regularly collect wash water and carpet cleaning waste as part of their work? If yes, where are they planning to dispose of this wastewater?</li>
<li>Do they clean up any moss or paint chips left on your yard after powerwashing or painting? If yes, how?</li>
<li>What type of cleaners, if any, do they plan to use? </li>
<li>How will they wash out any brushes, rollers, or other equipment after the work is done? </li>
<li>Whether using a contractor or doing the work yourself, you are responsible for protecting our waterways from pollutants. <strong>Remember: Only rain down the drain. </strong></li>
<li>Never dispose of cleaning waste or wash water from paint brushes/rollers in the public street or in stormwater drains.</li>
<li>Use a ground cloth to capture paint chips and drips. Sweep up any loose chips and dispose of them properly.</li>
<li>When power washing, collect moss and fir needles and put them in the trash. </li>
<li>Use only cold water to rinse down your patio or driveway and do not use bleach or peroxide-based cleaners, which can damage pipes and harm wildlife. Even biodegradable and &ldquo;non-toxic&rdquo; cleaners are prohibited in our stormwater drains.</li>

<h2 id="moss">Moss Removal</h2>

<p>Moss thrives in the Pacific Northwest courtesy of our rainy, mild winters. When you use moss-killing chemical treatments on your roof, those chemicals don&#39;t just stay there. Rain that runs off your roof ends up in our streams or groundwater untreated, and the chemicals that kill moss can also kill fish. Here are some tips to deal when dealing with moss:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prevent moss where you can by trimming trees, removing leaves and fir needles, and using a dry brush. Doing this in summer will reduce the impacts of our rainy winters.</li>
<li>If using a moss-prevention product, try to find the least toxic option possible and always carefully follow the instructions on the label.</li>
<li>Never use laundry detergent, peroxide or soaps on your roof. These products won&#39;t stay on your roof or property. As soon as it rains, they are carried into gutters and downspouts, which then flow into nearby streams, adding pollution and harming fish and wildlife.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pools">Pools and Hot Tubs</h2>

<p>Need to drain your pool or hot tub? Do it right to protect our streams and groundwater.</p>

<ul>
<li>Always use a sanitary sewer connection or cleanout, if you have one.</li>
<li>Never drain pools or hot tubs into a septic system.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have sanitary sewer access, let chlorine degrade by leaving the pool or tub uncovered in the sun, then drain slowly through landscaping.</li>
<li>About a week before you plan to drain your pool or hot tub, uncover the top, stop chemical treatment and turn off the heater. Use test strips to check for chlorine (must be 0.10 ppm or less) and pH (must be between 6 &amp; 8), then slowly drain off the water. Never drain on a neighboring property or directly into the public street.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stormwater">Private Stormwater Facilities</h2>

<p>Do you know where the storm drains in your neighborhood go? Sometimes, the storm drains are set up so rain runoff flows directly to our creeks and rivers. Often, however, they make a stop at a biofiltration swale or other stormwater facility first.</p>

<p>If you have a stormwater facility in your neighborhood, it may look like a grassy, wide ditch or it may be a rain garden with plantings such as grasses and shrubs.</p>

<p>Some neighborhoods even have private ponds for their runoff. If you have one of these in your neighborhood, maintenance usually falls to the Homeowner&rsquo;s Association and may be part of the common areas tended by a landscaping company.</p>

<p>The most important part of a neighborhood stormwater facility is keeping it working for flood control and water quality.

You&#39;ll find videos, troubleshooting tips and fact sheets to share with neighbors.</p>
