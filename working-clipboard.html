<h2>2022 Summer Project Pavement Work</h2>

<p><strong>Pavement Management Program | Updated June 2022</strong></p>

<h3>General Timelines</h3>

<p>Vancouver&rsquo;s Pavement Management program begins with preparations such as ADA curb ramp upgrades, tree/vegetation pruning and preliminary pavement crack sealing/repairs. This work usually takes place from March through early July. Federal requirements mandate that curb ramps be upgraded to current ADA-compliant standards along streets receiving treatments that are considered an alteration, such as paving or cape sealing. In areas where ADA-compliant ramps exist, no changes are required.</p>

<p>The Pavement Management work of resurfacing, rehabilitation and pavement preservation typically occur from the middle of June through early September. Any striping/pavement markings removed during street work will be reapplied after the surface is ready. Please allow for curing time and weather conditions.</p>
