<h2>Position Information</h2>

<p>In February, the City of Vancouver launched a nationwide recruitment process to hire Vancouver&rsquo;s next police chief. The City is conducting a search due to the upcoming retirement of Chief James McElvain.</p>

<p>The City is committed to an open and transparent search for Vancouver&rsquo;s next police leader. The City has contracted with Bob Murray and Associates to help manage the recruitment and hiring process. The goal is to appoint Vancouver&rsquo;s next chief in June. We invite you to stay involved and to share your thoughts using the link below.</p>

<p>Like many communities, policing in Vancouver is experiencing change. Concerns such as transparency, accountability, and diversity and equity match those of effectiveness of policing. This, along with changes in local crime rates, state level reforms, the national dialogue around policing, offers an opportunity to continue our support of effective, inclusive, and innovative police leadership as we launch a national search for our next police chief.</p>
