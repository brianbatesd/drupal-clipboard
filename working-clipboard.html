<p>Vancouver, Wash. &ndash; The City and nonprofit Harper&rsquo;s Playground will host a groundbreaking ceremony for a new, inclusive playground at Marshall Park, 1069 E McLoughlin Blvd., on Monday, July 11, at 10:00 a.m. The community is invited to this free event, which will include speakers from Harper&rsquo;s Playground, Mayor Ann McEnerny-Ogle, and others.</p>

<p>The newly designed playground will retain the Chelsea Anderson Memorial and the fire department theme throughout. The playscape, which will feature fully accessible and explorable play areas and equipment that meets the social and physical needs of children and older adults, is Harper&rsquo;s Playground&rsquo;s largest project to date. Playground elements will foster intergenerational exchange and collaboration among diverse abilities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Partnering with Harper&rsquo;s Playground on this project allows us to continue our vision to place fully accessible playgrounds throughout Vancouver,&rdquo; said Julie Hannon, Parks, Recreation and Cultural Services Director. &ldquo;The Chelsea Anderson Memorial playground is beloved and well-used. We&rsquo;re looking forward to carrying on the legacy of the Anderson family and those who originally helped build this special playground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As of July 1, Harper&rsquo;s Playground has raised a total of $1,931,800 in cash and pledged donations toward the estimated $3,000,000 in construction costs. Harper&rsquo;s Playground continues to fundraise to cover the design, construction, and some equipment costs; Vancouver&rsquo;s Parks Department will invest $250,000 in equipment purchases.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harper&rsquo;s Playground is honored to lead the design and construction of a playscape dedicated to the health and happiness of all children. Harper Goldberg, a Vancouver resident, and the inspiration for our nonprofit, deserves the opportunity to spend time around other kids. And the good people of Vancouver deserve the chance to meet Harper and others like her. That&#39;s the beauty of creating an inclusive world&mdash;we all win,&rdquo; said Harper&rsquo;s Playground Founder and Executive Director G Cody QJ Goldberg.</p>
