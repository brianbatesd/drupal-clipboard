<p><em><strong>Update 6/24/2022:</strong> </em></p>

<p><em>Starting today, when you visit Marshall Park, you will see a fence around the beloved Chelsea Anderson Memorial playground. The play structure is closed because of safety issues. A recent inspection shows that there are too many safety issues to allow continued play on the equipment. </em></p>

<p><em>We&rsquo;re sorry for the inconvenience. We know that this playground is an important part of Marshall Park and we&rsquo;re looking forward building a new play structure soon.</em></p>

<p>This 14-acre community park serves the downtown and central Vancouver area. The Chelsea Anderson Playstation was installed in partnership with the Vancouver Fire Department. Marshall Community Center, Luepke Senior Center and the Marshall Community Park Garden are located on site.</p>

<p>The <a href="/node/1071">Nature Play</a> area was funded by a grant by the <a href="http://www.parksfoundation.us/">Parks Foundation of Clark County</a> and installed with staff and volunteers as part of the Nature Explore Club program in 2011.</p>
