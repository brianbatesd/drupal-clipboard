<h2>History</h2>

<p>Design review for the downtown area of the city of Vancouver was established in 1978 to assist architects and developers in their efforts to ensure quality design in their projects as well as compatibility of development projects with existing developments and city goals. In the past, the city used a Design Review Committee to review projects. Currently these projects are reviewed by city planners.</p>
