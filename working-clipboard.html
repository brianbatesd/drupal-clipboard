<p>The City of Vancouver is seeking applicants to serve as the city&rsquo;s volunteer representative on the Clark County Mosquito Control District Board of Trustees. Applications must be received by 5 p.m. June 9.</p>

<p>The 10-member board of trustees includes one representative from each city within Clark County, with three members appointed by the Board of County Councilors. The board of trustees oversees the administration and operation of the county&rsquo;s Mosquito Control District, including adopting the district&rsquo;s work plan, preparing and approving expenditures, and contracting for services to keep mosquito populations below levels where they become a nuisance or a public health problem leading to an outbreak of disease.</p>

<p>Board members are appointed to two-year terms. Applicants for this recruitment must be city residents and must be available for an interview with Vancouver city councilmembers at a date to be determined.</p>

<p>Terms on this board are for two years but this seat would be for a mid-term appointment that expires in December 2023. A member could then seek reappointment for additional two-year terms, if they choose. </p>

<p>Regular board of trustees meetings are currently being held virtually. They occur at 7 p.m. on the second Tuesday of February, May, August and November. </p>
