<h2>Education</h2>

<p>With the implementation of some of the capital projects there are new types of facilities being added to the transportation system. informational materials such as, fliers, and other outreach materials have been developed to help all system users.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2>Collision Information</h2>

<p>To better understand safety trends and issues on the transportation system, the City continues to complete plans, studies, and tools to utilize collision data. </p>

<ul>
<li>In 2018 the City completed its first comprehensive collision analysis, known as the <a href="/node/72161">Transportation System Safety Analysis</a> (TSSA). The project focused on developing a baseline analysis for citywide collisions and tools to help the City proactively address current and future priority collision locations and patterns.</li>
<li>Building on the TSSA, <a href="https://www.beheardvancouver.org/vancouvermoves">Vancouver Moves</a> is an update to the City&#39;s first Transportation System Plan that was adopted in 2004. As a first step, the project examined existing travel conditions for all users of the city&#39;s transportation system, including those who drive, walk, bicycle, ride transit or deliver freight. Some of the key takeaways from the existing conditions analysis include</li>
<li>As part of Vancouver Moves, the City has developed a <a href="/node/72161">Collision Dashboard</a> to visualize crashes across the city in real time. The Collisions in Vancouver dashboard is an interactive display of collision data on streets in Vancouver. The dashboard allows users to view collision locations and information about the crashes using a web-based map with a series of charts</li>
