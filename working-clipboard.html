<p>Vancouver&#39;s Heights District is envisioned as a vibrant neighborhood center that is sustainable, healthy, equitable, accessible, and safe. The district will include public parks and open space, diverse housing options affordable to a wide range of community members, and safe multimodal travel options.</p>

<p>To prepare the way for this vision, the next step includes the demolition of the vacant Tower Mall building and the adjacent Allstate/Bank of America building. Please note that parking areas surrounding Tower Mall will not be demolished as part of this phase. The Council is expected to award the demolition contract at its Sept. 13 meeting.</p>

<h2>Demolition Process</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/imageattachments/community_development/page/81824/tower-mall-demolition_areas_map-web.jpg"><img class="image-right" src="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/imageattachments/community_development/page/81824/tower-mall-demolition_areas_map-web.jpg" /></a>During the month of September 2021 and prior to demolition, Vancouver&rsquo;s public safety teams may be using the site as a training opportunity to enhance rescue and response skills. As a result, nearby residents may notice safety vehicles and activity on the site at various times. Details are not yet available.</p>

<p>Starting about October 2021, contractors for the city will begin the demolition process within the interior of the Tower Mall building. This process includes abatement of any hazardous materials, such as asbestos, in full compliance with all health, safety and disposal regulations, as well as salvaging of piping, metal and other materials.</p>

<p>Moving into November 2021, residents will begin to see the actual structures being demolished and removed. Demolition activities will only occur in the highlighted areas shown on the demolition graphic above right. An estimated timeline of the Heights District Plan development, is depicted below.
