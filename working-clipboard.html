<h2>Tell us what you think about the City&#39;s 2023-24 biennial budget priorities</h2>

<p><strong>By Vancouver City Manager Eric Holmes</strong></p>

<p>Development of the City&rsquo;s 2023-2024 biennial budget is starting. The budget serves as a plan for the City on how resources will be allocated to provide services to the community. The budget process is also vital for transparency and provides financial accountability to Vancouver residents</p>

<p>As City Manager, I&rsquo;m responsible under City Charter and state budget law for preparation and delivery of a recommended budget to City Council for the upcoming biennium no later than October 1. Final adoption of the budget by City Council is required no later than the first Council meeting in December.</p>

<h3>How you can help</h3>

<p>This spring, I engaged with City Council on a series of budget topics, seeking their direction and affirming their policy priorities as I continue to develop my recommended budget to submit to Council this fall. Now it&rsquo;s your turn. I&rsquo;m asking you to share your thoughts that will help shape our budget priorities. </p>

<p>I want to learn what matters most to the Vancouver community when it comes to livability and services, as well as economic, social, and environmental concerns. The policy priorities City Council confirmed earlier this year for the 2023-24 budget are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce Carbon Footprint</li>
<li>Grow Economic Opportunity</li>
<li>Improve Community Safety and Wellbeing</li>
<li>Build and Maintain Exceptional Public Spaces and Places</li>
<li>Improve Equity and Inclusion</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, we can all see our community is rapidly growing &ndash; this year our population was estimated to be 197,600 &ndash; nearly 7,000 more people than when we adopted the current 2021-2022 budget. So while I want to focus our resources on the above policy priorities, we also need to meet the ongoing service needs of a rapidly growing city.</p>

<p>By August 22, please use our interactive tool on <a href="https://www.beheardvancouver.org/citybudget?tool=news_feed#tool_tab">Be Heard Vancouver</a> to tell us how you would rank the policy priorities. The City will use your input, along with other touchpoints, in developing the 2023-24 biennium budget.</p>
