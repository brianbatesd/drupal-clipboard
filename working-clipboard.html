<p>Vancouver Urban Forestry distributes free yard trees through our Yard Tree Giveaway Program in the fall. Yard trees are trees planted on private, residential property in the City of Vancouver.</p>

<p>Based on a 2021 tree canopy study, private property in Vancouver has the most potential to grow our community&#39;s urban forest. Vancouver&#39;s total tree canopy is only 19%, which means we are missing out on the many environmental, economic, health and social benefits that a healthy tree canopy provides. Planting trees on private property will help meet our goal of 28% tree canopy by 2030.</p>
