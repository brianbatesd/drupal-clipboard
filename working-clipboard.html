<p>Columbia Street, from Columbia Way to 45th Street, is a coordinated, joint effort of the City&#39;s Pavement Management Program and the City&#39;s Columbia Street Mobility Project. This webpage is intended as a central location for updates on the construction activity that is taking place. Look for updates to be posted below as information becomes available. </p>

<p>There are multiple phases to this project, as noted in the general timeline shown above. Current information and details can be found below.</p>

<h2>June 2022 Update</h2>

<p><strong>Columbia Street will continue to be closed between West 6th and 8th streets during the week of June 20,</strong> as contractors prepare underground electrical work for a new flashing beacon and lighting. The new flashing pedestrian beacon will be installed later between 7th and 8th streets (between Esther Short Park and Vancouver Center).</p>

<p>The street will be closed to through traffic from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day, with the street being reopened at the end of each day. Local access for on-street parking at adjacent residential complexes will remain open, but vehicular traffic will be detoured using other downtown streets.</p>

<h2>May 2022 Update</h2>

<p>During the week of May 30, the City will begin work to install safety and mobility enhancements along Columbia Street as part of the ongoing Columbia Street Mobility Project features. These enhancements are a part of the Columbia Street Safety &amp; Mobility Project, and this portion of the project is being funded by a grant from the <a href="https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/support-local-programs/funding-programs/pedestrian-bicycle-program">Washington State Department of Transportation Pedestrian and Bicycle Program.</a></p>

<p>Construction is expected to begin May 31, with project completion anticipated by the end of 2022, weather, materials, and construction conditions permitting. Work hours are planned for 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, but could be as late as 8 p.m. and include weekends if needed. Project work will occur along Columbia Street, from Columbia Way to NW 45th Street, and include new signing, striping, illumination, flashing pedestrian beacon, bike counter cameras and visible cycle lane separators.</p>

<p><strong>Safety and mobility enhancements</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>New marked crosswalks and street lighting at five intersections on Columbia Street at 28th, 30th, 31st, 32nd, 36th streets</li>
	<li>Street lighting and rectangular <a href="https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/ped_bike/step/docs/TechSheet_RRFB_508compliant.pdf">rapid flashing beacon (PDF)</a> assembly at the existing mid-block crosswalk between 7th and 8th streets (between Esther Short Park and Vancouver Center)</li>
	<li>Two new pavement markings showing &ldquo;two-stage left turn&rdquo; bike boxes installed at Columbia and 8th Street. <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/cdd/page/traveling-safely-community">Learn about bike boxes</a>. </li>
	<li>Zicla Zebra light-reflecting separators between bicycle and vehicle travel lanes on Columbia Street between 8th Street and 45th Street</li>
	<li>Automated bike/pedestrian counters at three key locations along the Columbia Street corridor: Mill Plain Boulevard, 28th Street and 36th Street. The counters collect and count use by bikes and pedestrians to help evaluate all traffic along the corridor. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Schedule </strong>(<a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/sites/default/files/fileattachments/public_works/page/69531/columbia_street_construction_timeline.pdf">view general timeline PDF</a>)<br />
<br />
Work will begin in May and continue into July with the contractor completing underground electrical work for the new lighting and flashing beacon first. During August, signing and striping will be installed. This will also include placement of the Zicla Zebra separators between bicycle and vehicle travel lanes on Columbia between 8th Street and 45th Street. Then, over the next few months that follow, you may see less activity along Columbia while we await the arrival and testing of the needed beacon signal components and street lighting equipment. This is not unusual, as equipment is part of the project bid and cannot be ordered until after the contract had been awarded.</p>

<h2>February 2022 Update</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Remaining Mobility Project Features:</strong> The technical bid proposal and contract document for the remaining Columbia Street Safety &amp; Mobility Project features is now available <a href="https://www.cityofvancouver.us/cdd/page/technical-documents">under Technical Documents on the West Side Mobility Project webpage</a>. It is also posted on the city&#39;s Procurement webpage. If you have questions about the coming features, please review the information below under Other Mobility Project Features and/or visit the project webpage noted above.</li>
	<li><strong>Tree Planting:</strong> Urban Forestry staff worked with residents and businesses along the corridor to plant new trees as part of this project. Nearly 50 street and yard trees were requested through that outreach, and the planting of these new trees occurred on Saturday, Jan. 29, 2022. Thank you to all who helped.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overall Project</h2>

<p>Through the annual Pavement Management Program, contractors for the City have paved Columbia Street from Mill Plain Boulevard to 45th Street, and microsurfaced Columbia Street from Mill Plain Boulevard south to Columbia Way. Speed tables were added where specified to help calm traffic. Following this work, bicycle lanes were striped along the corridor and pavement markings, such as green bike boxes, were added in accordance with Mobility Project plans. Additional planned features are coming in 2022. Mobility Project improvements are intended to support safety and ability for people who bike, walk or use mobility devices to travel the corridor.</p>

<p>Please be sure to help support businesses here and throughout Vancouver during pavement and construction work.</p>

<h3>Reminder about Schedules</h3>

<p>Please remember that construction schedules can and often do change. Weather and construction materials are critical factors in most Pavement Management work, as well as during some parts of the coming Mobility Project work. Please note that timing of work can vary, with some tasks being completed earlier than expected and others a little later depending upon construction issues and weather.</p>
